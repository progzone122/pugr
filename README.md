# PUGR (Photopea Useless Gap Remover)

[pugr (Photopea Useless Gap Remover) logo](./logo.png)

Tampermonkey script that removes the large and useless right margin in the Photopea interface â€” the space reserved for ads that remain even when using an AdBlock.<br />
The script expands the workspace and makes the interface more user-friendly.
